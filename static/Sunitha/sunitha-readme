"getgeocoding-lat-lon-with-api.ipynb" file used to gather the geolocations form the api
https://pypi.python.org/pypi/geopy

and
 
Google Maps api:

How to run the visualizations:

1) cd $GunViolence_Group_Project2/

   The reason  we use the http.server to run:
   remember that you’ll need to run a local web server to serve the HTML / CSV
   you’re just opening the HTML file from your computer directly
   
    python -m http.server
