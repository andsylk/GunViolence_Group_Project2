This is the google doc of the initial proposal:
https://docs.google.com/document/d/1eID_ZIPgNmq40EGlF5Yd8RfJSJqiLcV29Jqr2s2JmY8/edit

"getgeocoding-lat-lon-with-api.ipynb" file used to gather the geolocations form the api
https://pypi.python.org/pypi/geopy

and
 
Google Maps api:
https://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/geocode/json?address=Hawthorne&key=AIzaSyCLE_2Yfxa_y12nZv53kflN0oYnxYDcQVI

How to run the vizualizations:

1) cd $GunViolence_Group_Project2/

   The reason  we use the http.server to run:
   remember that you’ll need to run a local web server to serve the HTML / CSV
   you’re just opening the HTML file from your computer directly
   
    python -m http.server
